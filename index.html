							<h1>"Balapandar" logo concept</h1>
							<p class="major">An independent project i started in order to understand Illustrator better, and i chose to make a logo for my friendgroup, which is named "Balapandar" </p>

							<h2>Inspiration</h2>
							<p>This logo concept was inspired by a swallow,because the name "Balapandar" translates to Baby chicks from the Kazakh language, therefore i wanted to use a bird as a foundation to start the logo concept. Using a baby chick didn't feel good, as i was going for a different vibe. For that reason, i chose a bird that was closely linked to Kazakh culture, the swallow.</p>

							<h2>Style</h2>
							<p>There are plenty of swallow based logos out there, therefore, in order to make mine stand out, i chose to center the logo around Kazakh cultural ornaments. I chose Kazakh ornaments as my friendgroup was formed in Kazakhstan and all of us were Kazakh, and i wanted that side to be represented in this logo concept</p>

							<h2>Tools used</h2>
							<p>This logo concept was created entirely on Adobe Illustrator. The main tools i used for this project were the pen tool that was used to make the swallow, the path tool in order to make the text follow the circle shape, and the shape tool to create the circlular base of the logo itself. </p>

							<h2>The final product</h2>
							<p>The logo concept was made to be on clothing, therefore i tried to keep it simple and minimal.The logo features the swallow, the name of our group, and the year it was created (2019). I made five variations of the logo concept as i could not decide on one. All of them have a different swallow on them.</p>
